# Cricket Pitch Detection Project

Welcome to the **Cricket Pitch Detection Project!** This project showcases the application of various image processing techniques using OpenCV and matplotlib to detect and highlight a cricket pitch from an image. Follow the steps below to get started and interact with the project.

## Project Structure

- `notebook/`: Contains the Jupyter notebook used for the project.
- `images/`: Contains the images used in the notebook.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the dependencies required for the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone 'https://github.com/PrathamMadnur01/Cricket-Pitch-Detection.git'
    cd Cricket-Pitch-Detection
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Notebook

1. Navigate to the `notebook/` directory:
    ```bash
    cd notebook
    ```

2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Open `Pitch-Detection.ipynb` and run the cells.

## Notes

- Make sure the image paths in the notebook are correct and accessible in your environment.
- The notebook assumes the largest contour found in the image is the area of interest (pitch).
